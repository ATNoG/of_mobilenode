<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
This project mains to implement a flow mobility on the end nodes through OpenFlow tools. To accomplish that were used the OpenFlow agents Open vSwitch (OvS) to perform the flow mobility and POX as a OpenFlow controller.

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
This project provides the configuration of an OvS and POX that allows to perform a OpenFlow control path up to a terminal mobile user, and acomplish a handover request through OpenFlow control messages.

<h3>What differences can be found regarding other flow mobility implementations?</h3>
This project mais a SDN extension to end nodes towards heterogeneous wireless mobility, implying a new hop (terminal user) of the previous flow mobility imnplementations.

<h3>What does this mean?</h3>
This kind of implementaion aims to provide to the OpenFlow controller the capability to redirect the flows of an attached mobile node, when a handover request is triggered.

<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
